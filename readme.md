----------

Giel's fork.

Actual keyboard added can be found here in [mg_sofle_v2](./keyboards/splitkb/aurora/sofle_v2/keymaps)

To build the firmware file run the `compile.sh` script in the root of the project.

To flash the firmware to the keyboard run the `flash.sh` script in the root of the project. 

Enter the bootloader using any of the following methods:
-  Tap the QK_BOOT keycode (Layer 2 '-' )
-  Double-tap the nRST button on the PCB (near the TRRS connector)

Wait for the OS to detect the device.

You need to save the firmware file to both halves of the keyboard. Use the first method for the left halve, and the second method for the right halve.

This is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk\_keyboard firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) with some useful features for Atmel AVR and ARM controllers, and more specifically, the [OLKB product line](https://olkb.com), the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com) keyboard, and the Clueboard product line.
